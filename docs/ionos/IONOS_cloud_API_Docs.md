  description: >-

    IONOS Enterprise-grade Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions can be
    managed through the Cloud API, in addition or as an alternative to the "Data
    Center Designer" (DCD) browser-based tool. 

     Both methods employ consistent concepts and features, deliver similar power and flexibility, and can be used to perform a multitude of management tasks, including adding servers, volumes, configuring networks, and so on.

      IONOS' Managed Kubernetes (K8s) consist of two central building blocks:


      First, the Kubernetes cluster provides the control plane, although it is
      not directly visible. 


      Second, the node pools provide the worker nodes. While these are visible
      in a VDC, as Kubernetes is built on top of the compute engine, i.e.,
      servers, volumes, etc.
  - name: Cross Connects
    description: >-
      Cross Connect allows you to connect virtual data centers (VDC) with each
      other using a private LAN. The VDCs to be connected need to belong to the
      same IONOS Cloud contract and location. You can only use private LANs for
      a Cross Connect connection. A LAN can only be a part of one Cross Connect.


      The IP addresses of the NICs used for the Cross Connect connection may not
      be used in more than one NIC and they need to belong to the same IP range.

        behavior is now implicit, and the backend will perform this

        You can attach an existing volume in the VDC to a server. To move a
        volume from one server to another, you must first detach the volume from
        the first server and attach it to the second server.


        It is also possible to create and attach a volume in one step by simply
        providing a new volume description as a payload. The only difference is
        the URL; see 'Creating a Volume' for details about volumes.


        Note that the combined total of attached volumes and NICs cannot exceed
        24 per server.

        If a node becomes unusable, Managed Kubernetes allows you to recreate it
        with a configuration based on the node pool template. Once the status is
        'Active,' all the pods from the failed node will be migrated to the new
        node. The node pool has an additional billable 'active' node during this
        process.
